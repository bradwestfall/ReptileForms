	<script>
	$(function() {

		// This is the most basic usage of ReptileForms. Create an instance
		// of the ReptileForms object by passing in a DOM selector to reference
		// the forms you want to target.
		var form = new ReptileForm('form');

	});

<body>

	<!--
	Note that the default method for ReptileForms is POST if omited. ReptileForms
	will also use an AJAX submission by default and will use the form's action
	attribute as a destination. 

	Simply use normal W3 form fields with standard attributes as you would expect
	them to work. ReptileForms will disable the browser's built-in (HTML5) validation
	and use its own instead for more flexibility. 

	Name attributes are required for all fields and title attributes are optional if
	you want a label created.
	-->
	<p>Note: This form has the bare-minimum configurations and does not
	give any indication successes or errors. It does submit, however, via AJAX
	which you can monitor in your Network Console</p>
