## Basic Usage
###JS
```js
var form = new ReptileForm('.reptile-form', {
	validationError: function(err) {
		console.log(err);
	},
	submitSuccess: function(data) {
		$('body').prepend('<p>Success</p>');
	}
});
```
###Initial HTML
```html
<form class="reptile-form" action="/process" method="POST">
	<input type="text" name="first-name" title="First Name" required maxlength="20">
	<button>Submit</button>
</form>
```
###Resulting DOM
```html
<form class="reptile-form" action="/process" method="POST">
	<div class="field first-name required text">
		<div class="title">First Name</div>
		<div class="field-input">
			<input type="text" name="first-name" maxlength="20">
		</div>
	</div>
	<button>Submit</button>
</form>
```
## Basic Fields
Use `<input>`, `<select>`, or `<textarea>` tags with standard attribtues such as `name` (required), `type`, `reqired`, `maxlength`, etc...

## Field Attributes
Besides using standard attributes which will work as expected, use these attributes for additional ReptileForms functionality:
- `title` Will be used as a visual title and also for error message titles
- `data-exp-name` The name of the regular expression to use in validation
- `data-custom-validation` The name of a function to be used for this field's validation. This serves as a replacement to ReptileForms' default validation

## Custom Fields
ReptileForms was created with custom fields in mind.

###Initial HTML
You can create custom fields by wraping the any HTML you need in a `<div class="field-input">` element.
```html
<form class="reptile-form" action="/process" method="POST">
	<div class="field-input" data-name="terms" data-custom-validation="validateTerms">
		<span class="agree">Agree to terms</span>
	</div>
	<button>Submit</button>
</form>
```
###Resulting DOM
ReptileForms will will build the `<div class="field">` wrapper (and this time without a `<div class="title">` because there was no title attribute supplied. Also notice that we've provided a reference to some custom validation:
```html
<form class="reptile-form" action="/process" method="POST">
	<div class="field first-name required text">
		<div class="field-input" data-name="terms" data-custom-validation="validateTerms">
			<span class="agree">Agree to terms</span>
		</div>
	</div>
	<button>Submit</button>
</form>
```
###Register Custom Validation
```js
var form = new ReptileForm(/* Start Reptile Forms */);

// Register Custom Error Handling
form.validateTerms = function(formField) {
	// Where formField is a jQuery object referencing the <div class="field"> that is being validated
}
```
