	<!--
	Note that the default method for ReptileForms is POST if omited. ReptileForms
	will also use an AJAX submission by default and will use the form's action
	attribute as it's POST target. Input fields should be written without any 
	extra HTML around them unless you're intending to make custom fields (which
	are documented in a different sample page). Name attributes are required
	for all fields and title attributes are optional. If title attributes are
	supplied, they will be used to create visible labels
